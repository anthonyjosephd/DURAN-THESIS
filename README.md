 The COVID-19 virus was first seen in China in late 2019 and started to spread around the world by the start of 2020, causing casualties worldwide and health systems to crash. With this knowledge, the researchers embarked on a journey to make a Computer Program that can help. 


The main objective of this study is to design and develop an AI/ML integrated Agile Tracking System with deployable Mobile Embedded Systems for contact tracing.

   > Making a deployable automated contact tracing system.

   > Developing a central server that can communicate with deployed contact tracing systems


 > To develop a machine-learning-based algorithm that can detect the presence of an outbreak or hotspot through multiple factors. 

Each one of the objectives were successfully tackled, and given solutions
